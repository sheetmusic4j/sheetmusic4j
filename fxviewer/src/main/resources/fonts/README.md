# SMuFL font bundle

Sheet4j uses [Bravura](https://github.com/steinbergmedia/bravura) — the
reference SMuFL font — to draw clefs, noteheads, rests, and time-signature
digits. Because the font is a ~3 MB binary and needs a licence commit review,
it is **not** included in a fresh source checkout by default.

## How to enable SMuFL rendering

1. Download `Bravura.otf` from the Bravura repository releases or `redist/`
   directory:

   <https://github.com/steinbergmedia/bravura>

   Verify the exact path in the currently-checked-out tag before scripting it
   — the upstream layout has moved between `redist/otf/` and `redist/` over
   the years.

2. Place the file at:

   ```
   fxviewer/src/main/resources/fonts/Bravura.otf
   ```

3. Grab the SIL Open Font License text from the Bravura repository root and
   commit it next to the OTF as `LICENSE` (or `OFL.txt`):

   <https://github.com/steinbergmedia/bravura>

   The exact filename in the upstream repo has changed a few times; whichever
   `OFL.txt` / `LICENSE` / `LICENSE.txt` is present at the root of the
   currently-checked-out tag is the one that belongs here.

Bravura is distributed under the [SIL Open Font License, Version 1.1](
https://scripts.sil.org/OFL) — compatible with committing it to this repository.

## What happens when the font is present

- Both `FxRenderSurface` (JavaFX on-screen) and `AwtRenderSurface` (headless
  test / demo diff tab) detect `Bravura.otf` on the classpath and register it
  the first time they are asked to draw a SMuFL glyph.
- `ScorePainter#drawGlyph` prefers SMuFL codepoints (`SmuflGlyphs.codepoint`)
  and only falls back to the primitive/text shapes if the surface reports the
  font is unavailable.
- No configuration switch is needed — the code auto-detects.

## What happens when the font is absent

- `RenderSurface#drawSmuflGlyph` returns `false`.
- The painter falls back to primitive shapes: filled/hollow ovals for
  noteheads, ASCII letters for clefs, simple rectangles/zig-zags for rests,
  and plain-digit text for time signatures.
- All tests still pass on a fresh checkout — the diff test simply reports
  lower per-measure similarity numbers.
